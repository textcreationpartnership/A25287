            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> When Generous Wines have long waxed hot, the particles being much agitated, and by little and little being wounded, the ſpirit partly evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38179:33"/> being rapt up with the groſſer Elements, it is ſuppreſt. In the mean time the Sulphur (the abundance of which) is advanced by a greater agitation, and then the Spirit is brought under the yoke adhering to the ſalt, and lifting it up, it alters the mixture of the Liquor; then by reaſon of the Excellency of the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, combinated with the Salt, thence cometh the muſtineſs, even as with thin Wines longer kept. The Salt exalted, and made victorious, it depreſſeth the ſpirit, and from thence it induceth a ſharpneſs to the ſubjected <hi>Latex,</hi> and then afterward the exalted Salt which is in a leſſer quantity, getting the Sulphur to it ſelf, and joyning of it intimately to it, doth turn the ſubſtance of the Liquor from thin into thick, and as it were Oleaginous, and from a ſour ſavour into a very ungratefull, and (as it were) a Muſtineſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the Productions by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Fermentation in Wines, you ſhall ſee how amply the Analogy will hold between this Fermentation, and the manner of producing the Scurvy.</p>
            <p>It is to be underſtood, that the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments received into our Bodies, are firſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38179:34"/> concocted, and as it were gently boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Stomachs, by which means there is made a ſeparation of the groſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the excrementitious parts, which are unfit to nouriſh, and are caſt forth into their proper Receptacle, <hi>viz.</hi> the Guts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as it were by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fermentation, by which thoſe things that were before thick and groſs, are rarified, and thoſe that were fixed, are ſpiritualized, and they are made vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; and this is done by ſeparating their Excrements, that there might be an aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milation of that which is profitable to our Bodies, and to adminiſter a pure Aliment, that ſo they might afford mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to our ſpirits in manner as hath been above demonſtrated, in the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Wine: As <hi>Planerus</hi> brings that ſentence of his, That Meat and Drink in our Stomachs is reſolved into an Aire, which is drawn and paſſes into the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaraicks,</hi> and is changed by a certain Concretion into the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Blood; and not only thoſe parts of Aliments and Drinks are rarified and made volatile, as it were in our Bodies, but even that ſalt it ſelf which is in theſe Aliments, and is aſſumed in with them, though fixed, yet
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38179:34"/> are rendered volatile, ſpiritual and as it were Animal: And this is not difficult to believe, if any one will take notice how theſe volatile Salts and Spirits may be drawn out of Horns, and Bones, and Urines of Animals.</p>
            <p>And ſo while all things are well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in our Bodies, the Aliments are reſolved in our ſtomachs, and the parts unfit to nouriſh, are ſeparated; but thoſe things which are proper to nouriſh, are by the proper and peculiar Faculty of the Stomach and Bowels elaborated, and by that means rendered conſentaneous to humane Nature: But when in our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs and Inteſtines they cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that ſimilitude and form which they ought to have, to nouriſh our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>They are ſent to the Liver, which is (as it were) the work-houſe of the blood, to be more fully elaborated; but as the purer blood is elaborated in the Liver, the groſſer part of the Chyle is (by the large quantity of the <hi>Serum,</hi> with which it is moiſtened, and reduced to a greater aptneſs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uxibility and motion, and is attracted by the Spleen, and that part of the Chyle which yet remains thick,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38179:35"/> (by reaſon of Pontick and Acid Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) is there elaborated and changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood fit for the nouriſhing the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts.</p>
            <p>And theſe things being rightly done, and fitly ordered in our Bodies, the man continues ſound and in health; but if by reaſon of an ill manner of Living, and if they ſhall eat crude groſs and naughty Diet, and ſhall gorge themſelves with many ſorts of Food, ſo that it is not able to ſeparate from the Body, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in health and ſtrong, by the power of concoction thoſe vitious Excrements with which the concoctive power la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but ſo the Chyle abounding with many groſs and tartarous parts, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecondary Bowels deſtinated to concoction, it happeneth that theſe groſs ſalt and fixed parts cannot all be attracted by the Spleen, neither be all ſufficiently elaborated there; and ſo that concoction which ought to ferment, and as it were to ſpiritualize all the Aliments, is hindered, and the groſſer parts of the Food, with the fixed and tartarous, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in abundance with the Meats, is ſent away groſs, in its fixed nature, being not able to render them volatile, rarified
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38179:35"/> and Animal, as they ought, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, unprofitable, and tartarous parts cannot be ſeparated from the uſefull and profitable, whence the Bowels appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſecond concoction, at length waxe too weak to diſcharge the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of groſs humours, and by little and little are debilitated, &amp; from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth are rendered more unapt, ſo that they cannot correct the Coction and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration of the Aliment, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much thickneſs of the humours, and that which is deficient in the Rarification and Attenuation, (how to expreſs it in one word, is not eaſie) and from hence appears the Reaſon of the controverſie about the Name: <hi>Gr.

            <p>And therefore that Salt and the groſſer parts of the Chyle, when all cannot be attracted from the Spleen, and elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and attracted by the Liver, without Impediment, even that which is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler part of the Chyle, as that which is familiar to it, and naturally more apt to the generating good blood, and cannot expell all things from Nature, becauſe

            <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
            <p>THe Scurvy firſt invading, there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently a ſenſe of heavineſs and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs without a manifeſt Cauſe over the whole Body, moſtly about the Veſſel dedicated to Concoction, and that from <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> preſs'd out of all the Veins by the whole frame; for by the heap of humours in this Evil, there is need that the powers be ſtirred up.</p>
            <p>2ly, They are troubled with a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and ſlow breathing, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Labour, when the ſick is moved or ſtirred, by Reaſon of a flatulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour lying under and diſtending the <hi>Hypocondries,</hi> together with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts, the Diaphragma, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Reſpiration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Often-times they are driven over the whole Body, but chiefly through the external parts, as the Arms, Belly, ſides, Hips, between the Entrance of the back, having a notable paſſage by the Veins that paſſes down by the back, but chiefly the ſpots do bud and put forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the feet and leggs.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:38179:43"/> 4. When the Fountain and Fuel of this Diſeaſe is circumſcribed in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that neither much of it is powred forth into the veins, then either the Veins it ſelf, or both, do begin to ſwell in the Panch-belly, and ſo they are rendered bigger, but chiefly the Spleen, which ſwelling, or being puffed up with <hi>Affla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and glutted with the muddy part of the blood, it ſpreads to a greater mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth ſymptome of this diſeaſe is, that from hence is produced an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of the Body, by reaſon of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the more benign Aliment and nutritive Juice, or from impure Food, the blood being not ſufficiently clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Appetite, the Faculty of the ſtomack, the deſire of Food needfull and neceſſary to Life, is dejected, conflicting almoſt continually with a nauſeating, loathing and averſion to all food, with ſome it is dulled, but with others the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural habit of the ſtomack, is well-nigh loſt, and truely all theſe things are wont to happen by reaſon of the diſparity of the humour flowing, as from the Liver, ſo alſo from the Spleen into the Center of the ſtomack.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:38179:43"/> 7. The Seventh ſymptom is this, that ſometimes one, ſometimes another of the <hi>Hypocondra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> are afflicted with pain, and as it were with an obſcure deadneſs, wherefore they are vehemently diſtend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by winds or <hi>Flatus</hi> that hides, and are ſhut up in theſe places, from whence the power of Riſing up, and going doth ariſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Eightly, The pain of this place is not perpetually circumſcribed and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding here but every where, now here, now there, according to its wandring diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; now in the ſides, and anon in the lower parts of the Body, and by and by through the whole Body; and thus it very imperiouſly maintains its own bounds.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In the firſt which is extended to the Loyns, the Loyns ſeem as though they were broke, and in theſe there is perceived too much blood abounding in the great Veins of the Loyns, before the ariſing of marks, Buboes, the Haemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoids being ſtopt in men, and the monthly Courſes in Women; and other pains running over the whole Body, but chiefly the Joynts, ſometimes with, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without a tumour, ſometimes with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38179:44"/> a certain quivering, and diſcovering its ſelf of its own accord, and often times it reſembles the Gout.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The tenth ſymptome is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or ſwounding, which doth aſſault many, the heat and ſpirit being wearied, even as it is wont in the Hypochondraick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in which often times there is certain Reſpits or Intervals, as it were, the Spirits leading themſelves to the Caſtle of the heart, as to its ſtrong hold.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If the humour paſs downward, becauſe Nature with its own Gravity maketh it to travel into the Veins, there is pain, with a <hi>Flatus,</hi> and vexes their extream parts abundantly.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Some are Coſtive, or more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly go to ſtool, by reaſon of the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their bodies, but others are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with fluxes.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Urin appears muddy, and yet it neither reſideth to the bottom, nor hath any troubled Sediment at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p n="14">14. There is ſuch pulſation of the quivering Arteries as there is in them that are afflicted with a Quartan Ague, which is weak hard and frequent.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:38179:44"/> 15. And if the <hi>Praecordia's</hi> by reaſon of ill Living have been inflamed by heat, becauſe of the ſtraitneſs of the place, the matter having been ſhut in as in a hot Oven, a Fever will ariſe, gentle to the touch of the hand, neither having any period or time of Endings.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The Scurvy hath frequently its own periods, with which by little and little it is diſſolved, and returns as it were again <hi>per Circulatum vel circuitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. When the fleſh of the Gums by its nature being ſofter becauſe of its Texture, and being moiſtened with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours from the impure Bowels, ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the power of the heat from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, truly they then are moſt apt to be fill'd, and then it ariſeth into a leſs and fluid humour.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The Gummes do begin to itch at their roots, becauſe of a ſcorched, putrid &amp; ſalt humor, moiſtened by its <hi>Ichor,</hi> with which by its nature is acrid and ſharp, propagated either by contagion, being ſtopt no longer, and by taking another courſe, and afterward it hath by ſtaying in the place acquired an <hi>Acrimonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. The Scurvy is alwayes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with the ſtinking <hi>foetor</hi> in the mouth.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:38179:45"/> 20. Another Infirmity that attends the Scurvy, is a weakneſs and feebleneſs in the knees, for which cauſe, the ſick can walk but ſlowly, though he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour much, by reaſon that the Muſcles and nervous parts are over-charged with groſs and melancholy humours, as alſo a Contraction of the Nervous parts, that many cannot ſet their feet plain upon the Ground.</p>
            <p n="21">21. To ſome there happens an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtifneſs of the Jawes, that they cannot well gape or yawn, by reaſon of the ſtubborn ſtifneſs of the Joynt of the Cheek.</p>
            <p n="22">22. In ſome there happens a convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motion of the Muſcles and Nerves, in others a paralytick diſtemper; in ſome a ſwelling in their legges, in ſome the Scurvy and Dropſie are complicated together, in others there is an Atrophy, <hi>viz.</hi> a Conſumption of ſome one part, whiles the reſt are in good plight, by reaſon of undue attraction of Aliment.</p>
            <p n="23">23. There often happens a trembling and palpitation, and great Aſſaults of the Heart, and theſe Paſſions are meerly convulſive from the Cardiacous Nerves, to wit, of the <hi>Praecardium</hi> and Heart it
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38179:45"/> ſelf, by reaſon of the ſpaſmodical matter that beſieges it.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Some annoyed with wandring Fevers, and alſo ſudden ſuffuſions of heat, and alſo Cold in ſeveral parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, now hot, and anon cold, fluſhing heats in their faces, eſpecially after meals, untill the Concoction be over.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Alſo Scorbuticks are wont to be moleſted with copious ſweats, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the night, becauſe the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juice every day brought into the Maſs of blood, by reaſon of the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, impurity and foulneſs of it, is very little aſſimilated, being rejected of the blood, breaks forth under the form of ſweat; but becauſe that Nutritive Liquor, whiles it is aſſimulating, is made worſe; being ſick it produceth not a Fever in its own manner, the ſaltiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperature of the blood, which being leſs apt therefore, abideth in the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits; theſe immoderate kinds of Sweats, continual Fevers, with other Chronical Diſeaſes, doe often happen to ſcorbutick perſons, where the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive Liquor by fault of the aſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Blood is perverted more than the concocting Bowels.</p>

               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:38179:54"/>
               <p> There are required ſix Properties in good Beer.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That it be not ſoure, or any other unpleaſant ſavour.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That it be cleer, and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foecated, otherwiſe it increaſeth groſs, flatuous, and pituitous humours.</p>
               <p>The third is, that it be well boyl'd, otherwiſe it will be fulſome to the ſtomach, and filleth the body with windy humours.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that it be old and purged from its dregs; and by old is not intended two or three years old, but from ſix weeks to two months, or three, according to the ſtrength of the Beer, and as it is hopped; if it be ſtale, it is chiefly to be deſired in the Summer. Beer too new is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom, and ſo is that that is too old.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, that it be neither too ſtrong, nor too ſmall, but of an indifferent ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And the laſt is, that the Malt of which the Beer is made, be of a full and good Corn, as was hinted before: Beer made of Malt made of one part of Barly, and as much Oats, is more cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and is more fit for hot Conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>But this muſt be obſerved in Beer, and all other Liquors that are drinkable, that Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in them all, is the way to health, and they that obſerve not that, go out of the Kings High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and are Authors of their own hurt and Ruine.</p>

               <p>White and Rheniſh Wine are very pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for ſuch as be Rheumatick and ſubject to fluxion and diſtillation of humours to the Lungs, Breaſt, Joynts, or any other parts of the Body, and for lean Conſtitutions; and therefore let this ſerve for a Caution to ſuch as be ſubject to the Gout, or any Rheumatiſmes, that in ſtead here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they drink Milk or Water.</p>
               <p>Claret-wine is in Temperature and Nature very neer to theſe, but of an aſtringent faculty, which is clearly diſcovered by the aſtringent ſavour thereof; it greatly ſtrengtheneth the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, breedeth good humours, ſtirreth and quickeneth the Appetite, quencheth Thirſt, it greatly helpeth Concoction, exhilarateth the Heart; it is very profitable for them of a hot Conſtitution, that have hot ſtomachs, and are young, but it greatly offendeth a moiſt and cold Conſtitution that aboundeth with raw and crude humours, and is ſubject to diſtillations from the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38179:61"/> head, and this chiefly if it be taken immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. This Wine is chiefly to be taken with meat, for then it puts forth and proves profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the fore-recited properties; and above all this Wine is moſt hurtfull, in regard of the rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Nature of it, the moſt pernicious to Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rheumatick perſons.</p>
               <p>But being with moderation taken at Meals, it is for temperate bodyes, (being pure and quick Wine,) not much inferior to the Regal Wines of <hi>France,</hi> for it rectifieth the Stomach, and comforteth it; it is acceptable to the heart, and breedeth good blood; it is deemed the beſt of all Wines for Cholerick Bodyes, and for Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick the worſt. It is not good to drink this Wine between Meals, but in the middle of the Meal take a draught or two, and if you pleaſe you may dulcifie it with a little Sugar, and this will make it the more acceptable to the Stomach, and comfortable to the Heart; and by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe, you may expect a quickening of the ſpirits, a pleaſant Cheerfulneſs of mind, there being a good Concoction of Meats, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a healthfull ſtate of Body.</p>

            <p>Some time they are accompanied with a ſmall Fever, there happens a ſhedding of the Hair, a falling out of the Teeth, and when the Malida becomes very inveterate there are Cancerous Calous, Fiſtula's, Ulcers and Tophies, <hi>viz.</hi> in various parts of the Body a Caries or Rottenneſs of

            <p>Theſe are the Signs and Symptoms by which you may know this horrid Diſeaſe, and come to a Judgment whether you be infected, yet for your better Information (and that becauſe all theſe Symptoms are hardly, if ever, found in any one perſon, and if they ſhould, that perſon may juſtly doubt of his Cure) we ſhall give you a more particular deſcition of it. Phyſitians have given many differences of this Diſeaſe: <hi>Bruſanola</hi> hath given 234. Differences, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are uſeleſs and unprofitable,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:38179:73"/> the more uſeful are brought under the Number of Three or Four.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Differ.</hi> In former time it was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Phyſitians, That upon an Impure Copulation there immediately followed Gallical Symptoms, ſometimes they grew a little remiſs, and ſhortly after departed without means, but ſometimes there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed moſt grievous Symptoms, and thoſe very ſtubborn and hard to be Cured.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Differ.</hi> The ſecond Difference is fetched from the Cauſe and manner of the Contagion where the <hi>Leues Venerea</hi> is he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary, and was derived from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents into the Iſſue, with the Seed and Blood; but now having a Being in the World by an Impure Copulation, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by Kiſſes, Pocky Nurſes, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pulling on of Gloves, and ſuch like things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Differ.</hi> The third Difference is taken from the Signs and Symptoms eminently following, as Buboes, Gonorrhea, falling of the Hair, pains of the Joynts; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Symptoms and Signs which do follow, and are new, are not the ſame in all. <hi>Euſtachius</hi> tells us he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many Young Men to have lain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38179:73"/> with one and the ſame Whore in one and the ſame day, and nevertheleſs one hath had a Gonorrhea, another the falling of the Hair, another a Bubo, another a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, another a pain of the Head, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preternatural Effect, and all this hath happened by reaſon of the various diſpoſition of Bodies, and debility of the parts, and variety of Humours; for the weak parts do more eaſily take to themſelves the evil &amp; viſcious Humours, then the ſtronger one hath a more purer Body, another a more impure, and which being corrupted with the veneral quality, do ſtir up other, and other Diſeaſes and Symptoms, according to variety of Diſeaſes and Symptoms, which ſometimes are joyned and complicated together, do enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate fewer or more Differences.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Differ.</hi> The Fourth Difference is taken from the time, as this <hi>Leues</hi> is one while new, and another while old, ſome in the beginning, ſome in the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſome in the ſtate, and ſome in the declination, from which there ariſeth Four Degrees of this Diſeaſe from the Def<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, the time, the variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant Symptoms.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:38179:74"/> 1. The firſt Degree is moſt light, when only the Hairs of the Beard and Head by little and little, without any hurt of the Body, fall off.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other Degree is worſe, when the whole Skin is beſprinkled with many marks or ſpots, and Extuberations, and theſe Symptoms in the form of Lentills, ſometimes much more large, ſometimes viſciated with a redneſs, and ſometimes with a Yellowneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is more heavy, not only when the marks or ſpots, but alſo there breaks forth Puſtles and Hillocks at the firſt about the Temples and forehead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears, and then every where in the Head, but at length over the whole Body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But the fourth Degree of this <hi>Leues Venerea</hi> is when it invadeth the ſolid parts, the Ligaments, the Bones, Membranes, and Nerves, and corrupteth them, in which many Groſs, Glutinous, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Excraments are gathered, which when they abide about the Tendon or <hi>Perioſtium,</hi> they pull the Membrane, and drive it from the Bones; they are wont to ſtir up moſt implacable pains, increaſing

            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:38179:79"/>
            <p> Firſt it would extend this Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its deſign, being chiefly to acquaint how every perſon might come to a certain Knowledge of their own Diſeaſe. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, we cannot ſuppoſe without a <hi>Delirium</hi> in our own Brain, that any perſon that is infected with ſo Hoſtile and Formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable an Enemy as this is, and a Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick one too, would (being in his right Wits) neglect his Cure, and not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſeek out for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, ſome upon Examination find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſeaſe deeply rooted, the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms great, the Tyrant highly inſulting over him, might diſpair of Cure when it may be had, and ſo through miſtake, and too much timerity run themſelves upon ruine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſome who having but a lighter Touch or Infection might ſlight it, and think it nothing, as we have known many of this ſort, and ſo go on, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their own Cure, until they ruine themſelves, and their Relations (if they have any) whereas there are but few, or rarely any, but may be Cured, and of whom we our ſelves have Cured many, and ſome too that have not hindred the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38179:79"/> leaſt buſineſs, and have been under almoſt any reſtraint (Venery only excepted) and (their Relations being infected) we have Cured them, though to this day they know not what they ail'd; the <hi>Arcana's</hi> we uſe are ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> of that Power and Energy, that they Cure <hi>Cito tuto &amp; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunde,</hi> which is as much as any Perſon can deſire, ſmall in Doſe, and very eaſy to be taken, and may be conveyed (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are ſmall in bulk) to any place, and the Rules ſo plain and eaſy, that they may be obſerved without the leaſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, the Cure ſo certain, that one in a Thouſand almoſt need not diſpair of Cure, if they will be obſervant; for it is to be underſtood, that though many may be Cured wlth rhat facility as is hinted, yet all may not without being a little more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant in Rules ſomewhat more ſtrict, and were it ſo, we have conveniency for any that will commit themſelves to a more ſtrict obſervation, for privicy and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Cure in Caſes more than ordinary; and this is worth your obſervation, which though as you have heard the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe are numerous, and appear with a dreadful Aſpect, in foul Ulcers, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38179:80"/> and ſtinking Sores, filthy and noyſom Scabs, a gaſtly Countenance, lamentable complaints of dolorous pain, as you have abundantly heard, in ſo much that they might almoſt have this Motto written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>(Mortuus eſt)</hi> yet by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God. we have conquer'd theſe ſworms of Adverſaries, heal'd and dryed up the Ulcers, cauſed the Scabs to fall off like Leaves in Autumn, renewed the native heat, reſtored the Countenance to its former Floridity, Cured the Hectick, diſmiſſed the Conſumption, and in ſome made him a new Man, (as to his body) or ſo repaired the old, that there hath in many to this very day not appeared the leaſt ſign of the approaching ruine, to their great ſatisfaction, happens of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and Families, and though they have had Iſſue, yet theſe Off-ſprings are ſound, ſtrong, and enjoy perfect health, without the leaſt Token of an hereditary communication of the paternal ſpot, and in all the marks or concomitants of perfect freedom from ſuch things, there appears to be no difference from them and others, of whom there was never no cauſe of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy; nay, and leſs than of ſome who
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38179:80"/> are born of Scorbutick Parents, or others annoy'd with milder and gentler Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of this Allegation is, becauſe ſome doubt whether there be any certain Cure for Perſons, once infected with the <hi>POX,</hi> becauſe ſome, who either becauſe they would not be Regular, and have fallen into the hands of ſome bad and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expert perſons have fail'd of their Cure, or have been made worſe, or have paliat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their diſeaſe, have taken on them the Phiſiognomy of other Diſeaſes, and Mask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves under the Vizard of the Scurvy and Gout, to whom they are much obliged for this diſguiſe; for the certainty of our Cure, in this, as well as in many others, we could give you many Inſtances of perſons by Name, Place of Habitation, with Sex and Age of all ſorts, and theſe performed in Fourteen days up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on infants, who cannot obſerve Rule, and who went any whither, and did any thing but our own convenienſy, truſt by many committed to us, and love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour muſt prohibit our Pen.</p>
            <p>And ſo much may ſuffice for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of this Diſeaſe, as to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Cure, it cannot be expected
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38179:81"/> that we ſhall ſay any thing of that, for that would not anſwer the end propoſed, and it would be uſeleſs; becauſe they may have the Medicines that will certainly Cure of the Author, and at the place ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the Title Page, with plain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, ſo that they may be uſed in any Country, and diſtance from us whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

            <p>A Scirrhus of the Liver is a preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tumor in that part, hard and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Touch, and without pain, unleſs it be ſtrongly preſt, and it draws its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from a ſtubborn and inveterate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for the moſt part, but ſometimes, though rarely, from an Inflamation, and this is not done ſuddenly, but ſtep by ſtep; for in the firſt place the Humour, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Obſtruction doth fill and ſtuff the ſmall Veins of the Liver; this being done, from thence it doth rebound into all the ſubſtance of the Viſcera, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing it, and from thence the Veins hence being heaped up much fuller, the Liver diſtendeth into a large heap, that it appears ſwell'd, and then being dryed, and the thinner part by the force of heat is diſſipated, ſo all the reſt waxeth hard,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38179:97"/> and by the mixtion of it the ſubſtance of the Liver doth waſt; and at length there is produced a true Scirrhus more eaſily perceptable, eſpecially by the Touch, if the Party be tender, and the Belly be not fat, and the Sick lying ſtraight upon his Face, either in the left ſide, for it cannot be diſcerned without the Touch, for it is circumſcribed in the Place and Figure of the Liver.

               </gap>: The Name of a Catarrh taken in the largeſt ſence ſignifyeth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluction from the Head to the inferiour parts; but when it is taken more ſtrictly, it is defined to be a Defluction of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementious Humour from the Head into the Palate, Mouth and Lungs, having its Riſe from the Expulſive faculty of the Brain being excited.</p>
            <p>The Material Cauſe is a Flegmatick Humour, ſometimes inſipid, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times acid, ſalt and ſharp, and ſometimes alſo corrupt and hurting, the ſubſtance, ſuch as is begotten and gathered in the Head in a contagious or malignant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh, or the faculty of the Brain it ſelf being weak, chiefly by reaſon of a moiſt and cold intemperature, for that cauſe the Head is not able to concoct the Aliment deſtinated to the Brain, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it able to diſſipate the ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

            <p>The External Cauſes which do either multiply or preſs out this Excrementious Humour, and excite it to a Defluction is the more cold Air, Northerly Wind, cold Medicines applied to the Head, a ſudden change or mutation out of a hot Air into cold, and ſo on the contrary, the immoderate uſe of the more thin and clear Winds, as alſo by the flowing of hot Humours; hence it is that Catarrhs

            <p>The ſecond ſort is, when the Matter Ejected is like Water in which raw fleſh hath been waſhed, and this is called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patick, or Flux of the Liver.</p>

            <p>But the fourth and laſt is a <hi>Dyſentery,</hi> in this the Inteſtines are primarily affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which does appear by the Torments and Gripings of the Belly, and it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined thus, it is a frequent, crude and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Dejection, with pain and ulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Belly and Inteſtines, from a ſharp Matter Eroding, which is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Inteſtines. The next cauſes are certain ſharp Humours, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a peculiar and an occult diſpoſition with which the Inteſtines are Infeſted and Exulcerated.</p>
            <p>The remote cauſes are naughty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable Food, Muſty Drinks, Water that runs through Leaden and Old Pipes, the uſe of Autumnal Fruits, as of Grapes, and other ſuch like venomous and violent Medicines, the Air in the Spring being hot and dry, after a rainy aed ſlabby Winter, accompanyed with Southerly Winds; for oftentimes this Diſeaſe is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up at the end of Summer and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Autumn, and in Countries very hot, for it doth ſhew forth very much

            <p>The parts affected are the Inteſtines, ſometimes the thick ſometimes the thin, and ſometimes both; if this diſtemper be in the thiner Bowels, it bewrayeth it ſelf very much in theſe following Signs, The Torments do come by longer inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the pain is more ſharp, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to be about or above the Navel, the Feces and Blood are very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and mixed together, becauſe before they are caſt forth, they perform a long Journey.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XLII. A continual Fever.</head>
            <p>A Fever is deſcribed by ſome to be an inordinate Motion of the Blood, and its over much rage with heat and thirſt, and with many other Symptoms where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Aeconomia</hi> of it is troubled; ſome
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:38179:114"/> are continual, and ſome are intermitting; the acceſſion of a continual Fever extends to many days, unleſs it hath its own times of remiſſion, and of Exarcerbation, but never of intermiſſion; the inraged Blood induces a continual Fever in a Three fold manner.</p>
            <p>The Firſt is, when the ſubtil and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual portion of the Blood waxeth too hot, and is affected with a certain kindling heat, which therefore doth agitate the reſt of the Cruor, and doth incite it into an <hi>Orgaſmum.</hi> And ſo the kindling fury and heat is ſtirred up more than before in the whole Body.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Spirits are in the only fault, the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The ſecond manner of waxing hot is when the Sulphurous or Oylie part of the Blood being over heated begins to be hot, for then it waxes immoderately hot in the Veſſels, and oftentimes kindles in the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:38179:114"/> Heart by its own Flame produceth a very intenſe heat in the whole Body; and ſo that kind of Fever is produced, which is vulgarly called a putrid <hi>Symochus,</hi> which is Symtomatical or Eſſential; that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Symtomatical which draweth its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from ſome other certain Diſeaſe firſt ſtirred up in the Body; and that is a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of that ſort which hath its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon an an <hi>Angina</hi> Quinſie, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, <hi>Perihneumonia,</hi> a Wound-Ulcer or Impoſthume, either in any principal ot neighbouring part.</p>

            <p>But the Third Degree, and that (which doth conſtitute the diſtinct Species of a continual Fever) is ſtirred up from a certain malignant and venomous ferment, with which the Maſs of Blood is defiled, and the Spirit and Sulphurous parts takes fire together, and their kindling heat not firſt alaid, which may be either the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

            <p>AN intermitting Fever is not leſs violent and intenſe, during the time of the Fit there is in this a furious heat of Blood, as in a continual, yet this is not peculiar to an intermitting, it hath a certain time of intermiſſion, and for the moſt part every Fit from the time of the cold or ſhaking, and the Fits return with certain States and Periods of time; ſo that it can hardly be meaſured, more exactly by a Clock or Dial; but this furious heat of the Blood conſtituting this Fever doth depend upon the aſſimilation of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive Juice, the vice of the Blood it ſelf being fettered; for whilſt the nutritive Juice is not aſſimilated with the Blood; for although the Particles do perſiſt in the Maſs of Blood, as a Heterogeneus, and not of the ſame Stock or Linage; yet now it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Franciſcus Sylvius</hi> thinks the cauſe of all intermitting Fevers to be the pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atical Juice ſtagnant in ſome part of it or more: The leading Veſſels of the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas being obſtructed, and by its delay in that place is made ſharper; and that acid <hi>Acrimonia,</hi> and by the Flegm more or leſs viſcid is the cauſe of the ſaid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, the way being prepared, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating by force, and being poured out into the thin Inteſtine, and their ſtirring up with the Choller and Flegm the fury of the intermitting Fevers, are divided into <hi>Tertian, Quartan</hi> and <hi>Quotidian,</hi> the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> repeats its Fit every Third day, and if it be Exquiſite, it begins with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhivering, to which a ſharp and a biting heat ſucceeds, which is turned into a ſweat, and the Fit is finiſhed within Twelve Hours.</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:38179:119"/>
            <p> The Cauſes diſpoſing to this Fever are a Hot and Chollerick Temper, a youthful Age, a heating Diet, the more hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Air, Watchings, Cares, Anger, Faſting, over much Exerciſe; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Jaundiſe comes upon a <hi>Tertian,</hi> and then the Fever is diſcharged.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Haley</hi> hath written is taught for a very vulgar Experiment in perſons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring with a <hi>Tertian,</hi> that if Ulcers and Puſtles breaks out in the Lips and Noſe, it preſages the termination of the Fevers; for indeed it is as it were a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; alſo a Flux of the Belly coming upon a <hi>Tertian</hi> the Matter Concocted there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves it.</p>
            <p>Again a <hi>Quotidian</hi> is that wherein the Fit is wont to return every day, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it returns in the Hours within night, and without ſhivering, but with Cold only, or with a light or eaſie ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; from hence the Heat tranſacted in the time of the Cold is gentle and very little burning; the Fit is protracted longer, and oftentimes it is wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Eighteen or Twenty Hours.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FEbris Hectica,</hi> that is a Habitual Fever, or a Fever converſant in the Habit, it is a preternatural Hcat in the ſubſtance of the Heart, ſticking and burning in the ſolid parts, drying and conſuming, and brings the whole Body to extream lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There are Three Degrees of this Fever.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, when the dewy moiſture is dryed and conſumed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, when the fleſhy and fatty Subſtance, is depopulated, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, and in this the Extenuation of the Body is evident.</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:38179:120"/>
            <p> The Third is, when the Febra's and Membranous Subſtance is waſted, and the whole Body waxeth lean, then follows <hi>Facies Hypocratica,</hi> the gaſtly Countenance, and the Bones only appear covered with the Skin: This is the true waſting and Hectick, which of the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <hi>Maraſmodes,</hi> and which is incurable.</p>
            <p>The internal Cauſes of the Hectick are burning and continual Fevers, Ulcers, and continual inflamations of the Liver, Stomack, Lungs, Reins and other Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Thoſe things which refer to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cauſes are ſuch things as can gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate other Fevers, ſuch things as do very much either conſume the humid Subſtance in the ſolid Members, or very much ſtirs up a continual heat, or are apt to perform both, to which the promptitute and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſubject, and the continual diſpoſition of heating do make to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of this preternatural heat: Such are the heat of the Sun or fire, vehement Exerciſe, heating Meats and Drinks, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Excretions, as a <hi>Diarrhea, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteria, Animi Pathemata,</hi> or more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſion of the Mind. And laſtly Hunger, a more hot and dry Habit of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38179:121"/> Body is more apt to take this Fever. The beginning Hectick is not eaſily known, the other kind is difficultly Cured. The Signs of all Hecticks are common, the heat of the whole Body is equal, and of which they do not complain, nor do they underſtand themſelves to be Feveriſh; it firſt appears weak, by reaſon of the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Vapours; but if thou wilt apply thy hand longer there appears a ſharpneſs and gnawing heat, by reaſon of the dryneſs and ſolidity of the ſubject, and greater in the Arteries than in other parts, by reaſon of the communion of the Heart; and this Heat increaſeth one Hour or two after Meat is received, no other ways waxing hot than <hi>Calx Vive,</hi> if Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or any ſuch thing be poured upon it, the Pulſe ſmall, frequent and ſwift, the Urine oleaginous with a branny ſedement.</p>

            <p>The neareſt Cauſe of this Convulſion is an Irritation of the Nervous Parts, from any thing moleſting and troubling the Muſcle, the Animal Faculty, performing the Motion, being drawn into conſent.</p>
